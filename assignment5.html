            <div class="text-left">
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>Creating things with a milling machine was a different experience compared to previous assignments.
                    Thinking about how the path that router bit will use to cut through the material added to the design
                    challenge.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>Design and execution</h4>
                <p>I decided to create a box with two types of corner joints as shown in the blog post from Nadya. I
                    used a combination of finger joints as they are simple to create and fingertip joints for better
                    hold on the pieces. </p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>CAD</h4>
                <p>I started by creating the bottom side. I created dog bones at the corners to account for the path
                    that the bit will have to take when creating sharp angles. I found that it was easy to create the
                    same joint pattern on each side of the face using the <i>Linear Pattern</i> command to duplicate the
                    joint across an edge followed by a <i>Circular Pattern</i> command to copy the joint to the three
                    other sides.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>With one face was created, I created a matching face perpendicular shape for the sides.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A5-2.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>With the <i>Transform</i> command’s <i>Rotate</i> and <i>Translate by XYZ</i> options, I was able to
                    move the pieces to the correct orientation. The <i>Copy part</i> checkbox allowed me to quickly
                    duplicate pieces for the various sides of the box. </p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>After creating a shape for the front and back side of the box, the final box looked like this.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>CNC Milling</h4>
                <p>I exported the individual shapes from OnShape as DXF files. I then imported them into Kicad to
                    convert them into GBR files. This was then imported into the Bantam tool so that they can be milled
                    on the machine. Within Bantam, the placement x, y, z values had to be changed to account for the FR1
                    sandwich I was going to use for milling.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A5-5.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Milling was quick as my pieces were intentionally scaled small to begin with.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Once all the pieces were cut, I was able to assemble the box laid out flat.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Here is the box assembled.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h2>Learnings</h2>
                <p>Within Bantam, it was helpful to set the z-offset positioning to be slightly more so that I can
                    guarantee a cut all the way through the material. If I didn’t do that, there were slight variances
                    in the thickness of the material.</p>
                <p>In OnShape, it was important to allow for some tolerances between where the pieces came together. I
                    didn’t account for that initially and that resulted in too tight of a fit. I had to file down some
                    of the joints to make them fit.</p>

                <h2>Thanks!</h2>
                <p>Thanks to Kellie <a href="https://kelliead.github.io/">@kelliead</a> and Cindy <a
                        href="https://cindygfeng.github.io/">@cindygfeng</a> with their help on using the milling
                    machine. Also grateful for their tips on accounting for the tolerance so that parts will fit nicely
                    together. Even though things fit in OnShape, the physical world is different.</p>

            <h3>Assignment 4: Moving parts</h3>
            <div class="text-left">
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>Model moving parts in 3D using OnShape. Some things were easier to create in OnShape. Seeing the
                    parts being assembled and animate was very satisfying.</p>
                <p>I was interested to see how gears can be modeled within OnShape as this could be something that I
                    could use in the final project. This assignment was a good opportunity to learn how to do so.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>Design and execution</h4>
                <p>I decided to create a “hand” that can be driven by two gears. First, some sketches to plan out what
                    the final product will look like. It consists of a base plate holding the gears, two gears, and an
                    arm.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A4-IMG_20190508_003336734.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>CAD design in OnShape</h4>
                <p>Some math involved to design the gear. From online sources, I used the commonly used pressure angle
                    of 20 degrees. I also picked a diametral pitch of 24, 36 gear teeth. I then used the formulas to
                    calculate the pitch diameter, pitch circle, and outside diameters to get the basic dimensions of the
                    gear.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A4-IMG_20190508_003329684.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>I modeled the gear in Onshape in a sketch in <i>Normal to</i> view. Construction lines were used to
                    define the helper arcs and lines to draw the gear using the figures from the gear calculations from
                    above.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A4-1.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The sketch was then extruded to the thickness of the acrylic plastic sheet that I’ll be using to
                    laser cut.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A4-2.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The <i>circular pattern</i> command that allowed me to repeat the gear’s tooth pattern around the
                    entire shape. This made things a lot easier as I didn’t need to draw every tooth.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A4-3.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>To finish this off, an elbow arm was created.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A4-4.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Bolts to assemble the contraption was also created.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A4-5.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Everything will be mounted on a base plate with axels embedded within the plate for the gears.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A4-6.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>In the Assembly view, I hooked up the gears to the base plate using a Revolve mate, bolts to the
                    gears using a Fasten mate, and connected the gear’s revolve mates together with a Gear mate. The arm
                    was connected to the gear with a Revolve mate to allow some freedom of movement.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A4-7.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>3D printing</h4>
                <p>I decided to 3D print the base plate and pins as they are 3-dimensional objects. The pins were
                    exported as an STL file from OnShape. It was then imported into Simplify3D. The default Dremel Idea
                    Builder 3D40 settings within Simplify3D seemed reasonable and produced good results.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A4-8.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The same process was applied to the base plate.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A4-9.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Multiple parts were printed at the same time for efficiency.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A4-IMG_20190507_223936888.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>Laser cutting</h4>
                <p>The gears and arm were created by cutting out the shapes on a piece of 1/16” thickness acetal
                    copolymer sheet using a laser cutter. </p>
                <p>First, the parts that were modeled in OnShape had to be exported into a vector file like .svg.
                    Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to have OnShape export to a file that wasn’t either scaled or
                    rasterized via the built-in DXF exporter. As a workaround, I exported the shapes as a .stl file
                    first and then imported them into Rhino3D.</p>
                <p>Within Rhino3D, I first exploded the object to separate the faces using the <i>Explode</i> command. I
                    will use the face as the template to create a 2D representation of what I will be laser cutting.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A4-10.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>I then used the <i>DupBorder</i> to create a border outline of the shape. This was then exported as
                    an AI file for printing in Adobe Illustrator.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A4-11.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Minor adjustments were made in Adobe Illustrator to ensure that the shape will be interpreted as
                    vectors so that they can be printed quickly.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A4-IMG_20190506_235524177.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>Final product</h4>
                <p>Once assembled, the contraption looks like the following.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A4-IMG_20190508_003402750.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Turning the gears will spin the arm.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h2>Learnings</h2>
                <p>For some reason, the base plate couldn’t be spliced using Dremel DigiLab 3D Slicer. It produced files
                    that failed to copy onto the printer. One thing I noticed was that the estimated print time when
                    this happens is 0 mins. With advice from the staff at The MILL, I spliced the object in Simplify3D
                    which worked fine. </p>
                <p>I found that when converting from one file type to another, I often ran into issues where the
                    object’s scaling was off. For example, this seems to be prevalent after switching units, like from
                    millimeters to inches or vice versa, within OnShape. Dremel DigiLab 3D would incorrect size the
                    object to be too small. It was good practice to verify the scale of all imported objects and resize
                    them uniformly if the scaling was incorrect.</p>
                <p>Good thing Joshua talked about kerf last week. He was right that cardboard was very forgiving.
                    Plastic, on the other hand, needed to be precise for things to fit together.</p>

                <h2>Thanks!</h2>
                <p>Thanks to JoshuaV on his tips for offsetting edges. Also thanks to Haihua for her tips on the laser
                    cutter settings for cutting plastic. Lower the speed definitely helped with the quality of the cuts.
                    Jose Santos from Makezine provided excellent instructions for converting STL files for laser
                    cutting.</p>

            <h3>Assignment 3: 3D printing + lasercutting lamp!</h3>
            <div class="text-left">
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>First time using a 3D printer and it was exciting to see things drawn on a computer show up in front
                    of my eyes (eventually!)</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>Design and execution</h4>
                <p>I decided to design this assignment’s lamp around a hanging LED lamp from Amazon. The intent is to
                    create a desktop lamp.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A3-IMG_20190501_003734324.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Knowing that there’s a flat base on the original lamp, the idea was to build a platform that the lamp
                    will sit on and then add elements to create the lampshade for the overall lamp. I decided to extend
                    the base of original hexagonal shape.</p>
                <p>Within Rhino3D, I created a hexagon polygon that is slightly bigger than the original as a curve.
                </p>
                <p><img src="images/A3-1.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>I then used the <i>ExtrudeCrv</i> and <i>Cap</i> commands to create a 3D surface. To reduce the
                    amount of time it will take to 3D print the shape, instead of having the shape completely solid, I
                    decided to cut an opening in the middle. Taking advantage of the circular lens that’s on the
                    original light, I created a circle cutout that could be used to sandwich the light in between two
                    layers to keep it in place.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A3-2.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The lampshade will be used to create the structure that will be used to sandwich the lamp to keep it
                    in place. I created vertical support structures using laser cut from cardboard with notches that
                    will hold the entire structure in place. The vertical structures were created in Rhino3D initially.
                </p>
                <p><img src="images/A3-3.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The shape was then further finetuned in Adobe Illustrator to tweak the size and line thickness so
                    that it’s suitable for cutting on the laser cutter. Six of these were created on a laser cutter.</p>
                <p>In Rhino3D, it was easy to model what the eventual lamp will look like.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A3-4.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>With the base objects exported to .stl format, I imported them into Dremel DigiLab 3D Slicer so that
                    they can be converted into a .gcode file for printing.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A3-5.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Two base objects were printed.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A3-IMG_20190429_104003679.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Once assembled with the LED light inside, the final product looks like the following.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A3-IMG_20190429_113314865.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h2>Learnings</h2>

                <p>The 3D printer took much longer than expected. 3D printing a piece that was 90mm x 78.1mm x 2mm took
                    close to 30 mins at Low Quality 0.2mm resolution on the Dremel 3D45 printer. This meant it was
                    crucial to get the design correct on the first try.</p>
                <p>It was important to specify the dimensions when importing .stl files to Dremel so that the objects
                    were the same size as in Rhino3D. Again, transferring objects from application to application can
                    sometimes be tricky.</p>

                <p>I tried using <i>UnrollSrf</i> command to unroll a surface as a flat surface so that it can be 3D
                    printed as shown during class to create a lampshade made up of a repeated pattern layered on top of
                    a surface. Unfortunately, I ran into issues with extracting a surface. More experimentation required
                    to get this right.</p>

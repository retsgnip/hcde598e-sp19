            <h3>Assignment 6: Molding and casting</h3>
            <div class="text-left">
                <h2>Process</h2>
                <p>I made some plaster cast dogs using a silicon mold. This was fun but was a very sticky and messy
                    project.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>Design and execution</h4>
                <p>I looked at designs to cast and saw a dog-shaped phone holder on Thingverse <a
                        href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2459052/files">here</a>. Using this as inspiration, I
                    set to create something similar that’s casted instead of 3D printed.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>CAD design</h4>
                <p>I realized that there were lots of small details in the original design that could be a problem when
                    it comes to creating a mold or a cast. I decided to trace the original design in OnShape to make it
                    more manageable to mold.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A6-4.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Once the basic shape was created, I extruded the shape to give it some depth.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A6-5.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>I then created a box that will hold the mold. The box’s dimensions are the same as the machinable wax
                    block.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A6-6.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>The dog shape was inserted into the box as shown below. I then binary joined the dog shape with the
                    box so that it is one shape. I also made this shape smaller by 25% so that it will take less time to
                    make on the mill. This was exported as STL file.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A6-3.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>Milling attempt</h4>
                <p>I imported the STL file into Autodesk Fusion 3D. After setting the Manufacturer setup and 3D adaptive
                    cutting settings to match the Bantam 1/8” milling bit, I created a toolpath for the Bantam mill.
                    This was saved as a GCODE file.</p>

                        <source src="images/A6-Fusion.mp4" type="video/mp4">

                    </video></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>I imported this into Bantam Tool in preparation to mill the shape into a machinable wax.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A6-2.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, the milling machines were unavailable at The MILL when I was there.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>3D printing</h4>
                <p>Unfortunately, milling didn’t go according to plan. As a backup plan, I imported the STL file from
                    OnShape into Dremel DigiLab so that I can 3D print the mold.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A6-IMG_20190521_223056989.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p><img src="images/A6-1.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>Creating the silicone mold</h4>
                <p>With the mold printed, I combined the Oomoo silicone mixture together. This was very sticky and
                    messy. Good thing I used gloves and covered my workspace.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A6-7.png" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>I also applied some Vaseline to help it pop out later according to the Internet. This was then poured
                    into the 3D printed shape to create a mold.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A6-IMG_20190521_230134477.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>6 hours later, luckily the mold cured and it popped out without too much difficulty.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A6-IMG_20190522_071000560.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h4>Casting</h4>
                <p>I then mixed the plaster together and poured the mixture into the silicone mold.</p>
                <p>This was the end result. As a reduced the size of the original shape, instead of a phone holder, it
                    became a card holder.</p>
                <p><img src="images/A6-IMG_20190522_203937971.jpg" width="50%" height="50%" /></p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <h2>Learnings</h2>
                <p>Even though this took by far the longest time and most hands-on work as compared to previous
                    assignments, this went smoothly overall. Having Vaseline as a release agent created a barrier
                    between the OOMOO and the PLA 3D printed plastic.</p>
                <p>It’s important to keep in mind that small details like holes and crevasses might not make a good
                    imprint when creating the mold. Even though I tried to account for this when sketching the initial
                    shape, shrinking the shape afterwards didn’t help.</p>
